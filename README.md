Eventon - a flexible event managing system. It is written in HTML, bootstrap, PHP and SQL. User data is salted and hashed.

Was a part of our education practice, we were tasked with making a system for our school that would keep track of students, courses and programs. The initial system design was very limiting, as the system was only designed to handle the above scenarios consisting of students and classes, so I took it a step further – by designing a system that could be used for any kind of booking and event managing activity. 

The new system is instead based on three simple core features – users, blocks and events. Events can be anything, a course, a concert, a party, and can be grouped together under a block, which can be a program, a festival or a nightclub. This allows the system to be extremely flexible and used for multiple kinds of establishment. The system also has user level management, allowing for creating various personas such as teachers, managers, admins, students and so forth.

We're pretty happy with how the core turned out and continue to develop new features such as place booking and item loan systems.
